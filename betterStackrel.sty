% left aligned stackrel
\newcommand*{\lstackrel}[2]{ %uses leftsides smashoperator thus ignoring overlap towards the left
	\mathrel{% makes the resulting stack a relation class (like =,<,>,...)
		\smashoperator[l]{\mathop{#2}^{#1}}
	}
}% use when aligning to the left

% centered stackrel with stretchability
\renewcommand*{\stackrel}[2]{%uses no smashoperator, but adds back stretchability of \implies to the result contrary to \stackrel
	\;\mkern-\thickmuskip\mathop{#2}\limits^{#1}\;\mkern-\thickmuskip
}% use in \(\) and as individual operator without aligning neccessities
